### Installation
To install this library, you can simply get the library from haxelib like this:<br />
```bash
haxelib install extension-admob
```

Once this is done, you just need to add this to your project.xml
```xml
<haxelib name="extension-admob" />
```

### Setup
Set the following in your project.xml, replace value with your app id from Admob:
```xml
<setenv name="ADMOB_APPID" value="ca-app-pub-XXXXX123457" if="android"/>
<setenv name="ADMOB_APPID" value="ca-app-pub-XXXXX123458" if="ios"/>
```

For Android:<br />
You need to install the latest version of Android SDK Platfrom (31+), Android SDK Platfrom-Tools, Android SDK Build-Tools and Google Play services.<br />
Version of Lime (8.2.0) doesn't support (probably?) latest Gradle version.<br />
More details here: https://github.com/haxelime/lime/issues/1476

You need to set Gradle version in your project.xml file:
```xml
<config:android gradle-version="6.7.1" if="android" />
<config:android gradle-plugin="4.2.0" if="android" />
```

And fix some other problems with Lime, open file "\lib\lime\X,X,X\templates\android\template\gradle.properties" and add the following lines in the end of the file:
```
android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true
```

Also, you may need to set android sdk version to 31 or higher (as some versions of google play services requires that):
```xml
<android target-sdk-version="34" if="android" />
```

### Sample code
```haxe
import extension.admob.AdMob;
import extension.admob.AdmobEvent;

...

Admob.status.addEventListener(AdmobEvent.INIT_OK, onInitOk); //you can add more event listeners, if needed
Admob.init(); //set first param to true to enable testing ads, default is false

...

private function onInitOk(ae:AdmobEvent):Void
{
	trace(ae.type, ae.data);
	Admob.setVolume(0.5); //set sound volume to 0.5 for interstitial and rewarded ads
	Admob.setVolume(-1); //mute
	//you can start showing/loading ads after successful initialization
}

...

Admob.showBanner("[BANNER_ID]", Admob.BANNER_SIZE_BANNER, Admob.BANNER_ALIGN_TOP);

...

Admob.hideBanner();

...

Admob.status.addEventListener(AdmobEvent.INTERSTITIAL_LOADED, onLoadInterstitial);
Admob.loadInterstitial([INTERSTITIAL_ID]);

...


private function onLoadInterstitial(ae:AdmobEvent):Void
{
	Admob.showInterstitial();
}
```

Beginning 16 January 2024, Google will require all publishers serving ads to EEA and UK users to use a Google-certified consent management platform (CMP).
This extension use Google's UMP SDK and shows consent dialog on first app start.
If user does not consent, there is a high probability that ads will not work.

How to know, if privacy dialog is required (ie user is from UK or EEA):
```haxe
if( Admob.isPrivacyOptionsRequired() == 1)
	//required
```

How to know, if user consented to personalized ads:
```haxe
if(Admob.getConsent() == Admob.CONSENT_FULL)
	//constented, ads should work fine
```
Also:
```haxe
if(Admob.hasConsentForPuprpose(0) == 1)
	//most likely consented, you should check all the purposes, there are like 10 of them (0-9)
```

How to show privacy dialog to user again:
```haxe
Admob.showPrivacyOptionsForm();
```
